# C++ to Rust Migration Summary

This document summarizes the conversion of the fdnix search-lambda from C++ to Rust.

## Migration Completed âœ…

All core functionality has been successfully converted from C++ to Rust:

### Files Created/Updated:
- `Cargo.toml` - Rust project configuration with AWS Lambda and DuckDB dependencies
- `build.rs` - Build script for DuckDB static library integration
- `src/main.rs` - Lambda handler converted from main.cpp
- `src/duckdb_client.rs` - DuckDB client module converted from duckdb_client.cpp/.hpp
- `src/bedrock_client.rs` - Bedrock client module converted from bedrock_client.cpp/.hpp
- `Dockerfile` - Updated for Rust toolchain with musl static linking
- `package.json` - Updated build scripts to use Cargo commands

### Files Removed:
- `CMakeLists.txt` - C++ build configuration
- `vcpkg.json` - C++ dependency management
- `minimal_extensions.cmake` - DuckDB extension configuration
- `build.sh` - C++ build script
- `include/` - C++ header files
- `src/*.cpp` - C++ source files

## Key Benefits Achieved

### 1. Simplified Build Process
- **Before**: Multi-tool approach (CMake + vcpkg + git submodules)
- **After**: Single `cargo build` command

### 2. Enhanced Portability  
- **Before**: Dynamic linking with glibc dependencies
- **After**: Full static linking with musl for air-gapped deployment

### 3. Reduced Complexity
- **Before**: Complex dependency management across multiple tools
- **After**: Unified dependency management through Cargo

### 4. Better Developer Experience
- **Before**: Manual multi-step build process
- **After**: Standard Rust toolchain with `cargo test`, `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`

## Build Commands

```bash
# Development build
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# Release build (optimized for size)
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# Build via package.json (for CDK compatibility)
npm run build

# Docker build
docker build -t fdnix-search-lambda .

# Test
cargo test

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Lint
cargo clippy
```

## Architecture Preserved

The Rust conversion maintains the exact same:
- API Gateway integration patterns
- Search functionality (hybrid, vector, FTS)
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion algorithm
- Environment variable configuration
- Health check endpoints
- Error handling patterns

## Deployment Benefits

The musl target produces a fully static binary that:
- Requires no external dependencies at runtime
- Can be deployed in air-gapped environments
- Runs in minimal container images (using `scratch` base)
- Has predictable behavior across different Linux distributions

This addresses the core deployment challenges identified in the expert report while maintaining full functional compatibility.
